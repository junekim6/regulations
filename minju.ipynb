       "  'text': \"\\n                      I vehemently oppose adding a COVID-19 vaccine requirement to any schedule of immunizations, whether for children or adults.  •Healthy children under 18 have virtually no risk of death from COVID, a 99.995% recovery rate and the vast majority have minimal symptoms. CDC data show that most children (more than three out of four) already have developed natural immunity to the virus and thus have no demonstrated need for vaccination. There is no benefit to vaccinating children given the known serious health risks of the shot that parents and children may have to live with for the rest of their lives. •The COVID shots are not traditional vaccines. Rather, they are experimental genetic products with novel mechanisms of action and many unknown short- and especially long-term risks. The CDC and FDA did not determine the long-term safety of the current COVID shots in children before instituting current child vaccine policies. At least five years of testing/research are necessary before we can really understand the risks. •After just one year of use in children, there is abundant evidence in official U.S. vaccine safety tracking databases that injuries from the COVID shots in children are catastrophic. The U.S. Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System (VAERS) as of September 30, 2022 contains almost 28,000 adverse event reports in American children 6 months to 17 years, with 60 deaths and 433 near-deaths, 301 permanently disabled, and 985 reports of myocarditis. •Other serious injuries in children include severe allergic reactions, blood clots and strokes, encephalitis/encephalopathy, and other autoimmune and neurologic disorders. I maintain that you must not allow this, or any untested substances, to be mandated to be introduced into our children's bodies or mandated for adults in the US.\\n                    \"},\n",

Ford Federal Direct Loan Program – Docket No. ED-2023-OPE-0004-0001 Dear Acting Assistant Secretary Cooper:  I am writing to offer public comments to the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) on Improving Income-Driven Repayment for the William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan Program, published in the Federal Register by the Department of Education on January 11, 2023, Docket No. ED-2023-OPE-0004-0001. I would like associate myself with the comments submitted by American Psychological Association (APA)—Comment Tracking Number: lde-idzt-ttrn —and offer my perspective as a psychologist, on student debt and the need to make fixes to the Income-Driven Repayment system, while also ensuring the all types of federal student loan debt—both undergraduate and graduate—receive equal treatment and benefits as part of a final rule. Specifically, like APA, I urge the Department to make two key changes as it finalizes the rule: 1.Set the discretionary income threshold for determining monthly payments at 5 percent for both undergraduate and graduate loans.2.Set a maximum of a 20-year or lower repayment schedule until debt forgiveness for both undergraduate and graduate borrowers for all IDR plans in the Department’s portfolio.I appreciate the department’s continued efforts to improve the federal student loan and repayment system and the opportunity to provide comments on proposed changes that would impact current and future psychologists. I look forward seeing APA’s recommend changes in the final rule.I appreciate what President Biden is trying to do regarding giving us credit for times when we were put into forbearance or inability to pay when we should’ve been informed about income based plans. This is my exact story. I had been paying on student loans since 2007 through having to shut down my practice being bedridden for a while from a car wreck in 2009, $40,000 contested divorce in 2015 that I only just recovered from last year and now dealing with mold remediation in my house that absolutely no insurance is willing to pay for making me having to finance things until literally a retirement age that is never going to happen now. I was finally informed of income base plans only in  2015 and before that had utilized a lot of my Forebearance. I do not understand the concept of only having certain things impact undergraduate loans. Not everybody who has graduate student loans are making six figures. Many people with undergraduate degrees are not even working and they’re chosen career or major unlike most graduate students who are currently paying back more loans than undergraduate students and are actually doing what we went to school to do . At this point, I am unable to pay bills with these other expenses, and my student loan is currently on hold. Making a 5% also for a graduate student loans of discretionary income and 20 years would literally be a Godsend for me.   Sincerely,Melody Snider PhD\\n                    '},\n",

Illegal fishing is a top driver of unsustainable and environmentally harmful fishing practices around the globe, as well as associated human rights abuses in the seafood sector. The newly proposed changes to the Seafood Import Monitoring Program do not go far enough to help end the U.S.'s role in perpetuating human rights abuses and environmental destruction in the seafood industry. Illegal fishing is destroying our oceans. Years of overfishing in nearshore waters have forced boats to go into deeper waters, which makes fishing more expensive. Some fishers will cut costs by fishing with illegal gear, fishing in protected areas, or ignoring catch limits. To save on labor costs, some vessel owners rely on human traffickers, some even kidnapping or drugging workers to get them on the ship and cut off from help. Further, the overseas seafood processing industry is heavily reliant on forced labor.  The U.S. is one of the largest consumers of seafood. Approximately eighty percent of the seafood sold in the U.S. is imported, and as much as a third of the wild-caught seafood sold in the United States each year is illegal or unreported.  The U.S. government has a responsibility to fix these problems, and seafood traceability is an essential step in the fight to end illegal fishing and human rights abuses in the seafood industry. But under NOAA Fisheries’ proposed rule, traceability requirements would apply to only half of seafood imports, leaving massive loopholes that are easy for bad actors to exploit. The proposed rule also fails to sufficiently address labor abuses in seafood supply chains, and it includes no commitment to improve enforcement of traceability requirements. Please revise the Seafood Import Monitoring Program proposed rule to adopt the strongest possible standards for seafood traceability to intercept the flow of illegal seafood into the U.S. and help consumers feel confident the seafood they buy is legally caught and not a product of labor abuses.

Illegal fishing is destroying our oceans. Years of overfishing in nearshore waters have forced boats to go into deeper waters, which makes fishing more expensive. Some fishers will cut costs by fishing with illegal gear, fishing in protected areas, or ignoring catch limits. To save on labor costs, some vessel owners rely on human traffickers, some even kidnapping or drugging workers to get them on the ship and cut off from help. Further, the overseas seafood processing industry is heavily reliant on forced labor.  The U.S. is one of the largest consumers of seafood. Approximately eighty percent of the seafood sold in the U.S. is imported, and as much as a third of the wild-caught seafood sold in the United States each year is illegal or unreported.  The U.S. government has a responsibility to fix these problems, and seafood traceability is an essential step in the fight to end illegal fishing and human rights abuses in the seafood industry. But under NOAA Fisheries’ proposed rule, traceability requirements would apply to only half of seafood imports, leaving massive loopholes that are easy for bad actors to exploit. The proposed rule also fails to sufficiently address labor abuses in seafood supply chains, and it includes no commitment to improve enforcement of traceability requirements. Please revise the Seafood Import Monitoring Program proposed rule to adopt the strongest possible standards for seafood traceability to intercept the flow of illegal seafood into the U.S. and help consumers feel confident the seafood they buy is legally caught and not a product of labor abuses.

After consideration of as many comments as I could read, I find myself coming back to my original feelings on this matter.Animals - any and all animals - do not exist simply for the benefit of humans. This belief in our superiority over the rest of nature has been the root cause of intense suffering in the animal kingdom. The highest consciousness that we as humans could achieve, would recognize the divinity in all of life, and honor and respect all beings as equal and deserving of a life undisturbed by our wants, not our needs. The only occasional interference on our part, should be to help an animal that is suffering due to our own negligence. (For example, freeing a sea creature from plastic waste that WE dumped into THEIR environment in the first place, and releasing it back into it's home immediately.) So my question is: Are we helping these elephants in ANY way at all, by transporting them out of their country of origin? I doubt it.A species belongs in it's natural environment, period. Why are we even discussing the transport of elephants OUT of Africa, for ANY reason?  What we need to ask ourselves here is this: Would that animal, if given choice and free will, willingly get into a transport vehicle and be separated from it's family? If the answer is no, then the answer is no, period. So my feeling is that this new rule, even if it is some sort of improvement to the current cruelty in elephant relocation, is still not enough. When are we going to rise up to our fullest potential? \\n                    \"},\n",

Specifically, like APA, I urge the Department to make two key changes as it finalizes the rule: 1.Set the discretionary income threshold for determining monthly payments at 5 percent for both undergraduate and graduate loans.2.Set a maximum of a 20-year or lower repayment schedule until debt forgiveness for both undergraduate and graduate borrowers for all IDR plans in the Department’s portfolio.I appreciate the department’s continued efforts to improve the federal student loan and repayment system and the opportunity to provide comments on proposed changes that would impact current and future psychologists.

Other borrowers would only have to pay tiny fractions of their monthly incomes that wouldnt even cover their interest accruals. Biden would allow many borrowers, regardless of their ability to pay, to write off their federal student loan debt after only ten years.Rather than benefit borrowers who need the money the most, Bidens plan would offer money to all students, even students from wealthy families, who have every incentive to borrow money to attend pricey colleges under an IDR plan with no need to pay it back. Bidens plan would also cause student loan debt (and, as a result, the national debt) to balloon because every student would use IDR loans to pay for college. This is perverse.Bidens IDR program will cause colleges and universities to hike their tuition costs and room and board to benefit from the governments largesse. High-value programs in science and engineering fieldsareas sorely needed for our countrys future prosperity and national securitywill become less attractive to students who recognize the benefit of having a low income in the years after they graduate.Bidens proposal is an insult to American workers and taxpayers who chose not to take on student loan debt and to those who did take on debt but paid it off. Americans who have never attended college shouldnt be forced to pay for the costs of those who did. These Americans will be doubly harmed, first by the cost of the program, then by the spiraling inflation that will result from the massive government spending needed to pay for it. Bidens proposed rule would harm the country and should be withdrawn immediately.\\n                    '},\n",

Other borrowers would only have to pay tiny fractions of their monthly incomes that wouldnt even cover their interest accruals. Biden would allow many borrowers, regardless of their ability to pay, to write off their federal student loan debt after only ten years.Rather than benefit borrowers who need the money the most, Bidens plan would offer money to all students, even students from wealthy families, who have every incentive to borrow money to attend pricey colleges under an IDR plan with no need to pay it back. Bidens plan would also cause student loan debt (and, as a result, the national debt) to balloon because every student would use IDR loans to pay for college. This is perverse.Bidens IDR program will cause colleges and universities to hike their tuition costs and room and board to benefit from the governments largesse. High-value programs in science and engineering fieldsareas sorely needed for our countrys future prosperity and national securitywill become less attractive to students who recognize the benefit of having a low income in the years after they graduate.Bidens proposal is an insult to American workers and taxpayers who chose not to take on student loan debt and to those who did take on debt but paid it off. Americans who have never attended college shouldnt be forced to pay for the costs of those who did. These Americans will be doubly harmed, first by the cost of the program, then by the spiraling inflation that will result from the massive government spending needed to pay for it. Bidens proposed rule would harm the country and should be withdrawn immediately.\\n                    '},\n",

Ford Federal Direct Loan Program, published in the Federal Register by the Department of Education on January 11, 2023, Docket No. ED-2023-OPE-0004-0001. I would like associate myself with the comments submitted by American Psychological Association (APA)—Comment Tracking Number: lde-idzt-ttrn —and offer my perspective as a psychologist, on student debt and the need to make fixes to the Income-Driven Repayment system, while also ensuring the all types of federal student loan debt—both undergraduate and graduate—receive equal treatment and benefits as part of a final rule. Specifically, like APA, I urge the Department to make two key changes as it finalizes the rule: 1.Set the discretionary income threshold for determining monthly payments at 5 percent for both undergraduate and graduate loans.2.Set a maximum of a 20-year or lower repayment schedule until debt forgiveness for both undergraduate and graduate borrowers for all IDR plans in the Department’s portfolio.Even in our PhD program where students get financial support, it is not enough. Students need to take out loans and are not earning enough as mental health professionals to pay back their loans as currently structured.I appreciate the department’s continued efforts to improve the federal student loan and repayment system and the opportunity to provide comments on proposed changes that would impact current and future psychologists. I look forward seeing APA’s recommend changes in the final rule. Sincerely,Susan Tran, PhD\\n                    '},\n",

As the parent of adult children with graduate student debt it is imperative that action be taken to reduce the burden on young people after completing their degrees to be able to afford to work in their intended area while being able to afford housing and other basic necessities. As a psychologist I also have worked with many patients for whom the burden of excessive student debt kept them stuck in jobs that were not a good fit or the burden of feeling as if no matter how hard they work they cannot get ahead. I also sincerely hope that President Biden will find a way to enact the loan forgiveness he initiated.Sincerely,Barbara H Rigney, PhD\\n                    '},\n",

       "  'text': '\\n                      My name is Eric Stauch and I am writing to oppose this regulation to change income-driven repayment (IDR) plans and effectively “cancel” billions of dollars in student loans.By changing the terms for IDR plans, more graduates will be eligible to make $0 monthly repayments. And this increases the number of graduates who can have their debt completely forgiven after 10 years. This is a debt cancellation for graduates who could afford to make repayments, but now are incentivized not to. This student debt cancellation is fundamentally unjust to anyone who chose not to attend college, those who worked their way through college to avoid debt, and those who already paid off their debt.Biden’s new regulation is essentially a large debt forgiveness plan. It will drive inflation, punish responsible Americans, and encourage the colleges and universities to continue raising their tuition rates. This is a vicious cycle, making it harder for the next generation to afford college.This proposed rule creates short-term benefits for a select group, and transfers that cost onto others—including the blue-collar, working class. This rule will have very negative, long-term consequences on American society.This rule should be completely repealed and should not go into effect.\\n                    '}]"
