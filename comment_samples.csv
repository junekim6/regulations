I live in Minnesota where we have our own &#39;hardrock&#39; mining issue in the proposed Polymet mine. The proposed mine is located in a water rich area near the BWCA. Last I heard the State is requiring the mining company to put up money for potential cleanup costs while the mining is in operation and into the future as the toxic waste sits in piles and ponds. Last I heard the mine will be in operation for some 30 years and will provide good paying jobs to hundreds of workers. In other words, the mine will provide jobs for two generations of workers, three at best. But the waste will sit there in a toxic state for two or three hundred years. In a time span of that nature no one can know how invulnerable the containment of the waste will be to environmental conditions. And the benefit of the jobs and taxes and fees paid by the mining company, and the mining company itself, will be long gone.

Therefore, labels will need to include the same amount of grams of sugar under each category e.g. &quot;17 grams of Total Sugar&quot; and &quot;17 grams of Added Sugars.&quot;  This will confuse food consumers.<br/><br/>If this label is implemented at the commercial beekeeping level it will begin the misinformation to food consumers that sugar is added to honey.  Eventually, it will create confusion across the honey industry and mislead the consumer about a natural product.<br/><br/>As stated in 21 US Code 342 (b)(4), &quot;A food shall be deemed to be adulterated... if any substance has been added thereto or mixed or packed therewith so as to...make it appear better or of greater value than it is.&quot;   "

Together with the FDA&#39;s final rule reclassifying sunlamp products and the proposed rule updating sunlamp performance standards, this proposed rule will make a significant impact in reducing the incidence of skin cancer in the U.S.  I urge the FDA to finalize this proposed rule."

Employers can easily keep track of these records using computers or smartphones. I hope you will move this proposal forward!"

The proposed regulations will help to stabilize the home care workforce that is experiencing high turnover because of low pay and long hours. These workers help elders and people with disabilities stay in their homes and out of institutions and these protections will result in less attrition and better quality care.  I also support the proposed rule to require employers of live-in domestic workers to keep records of their workers&rsquo; hours worked. But it is important for the employers to keep other records like the rate of pay, total wages paid, or deductions for meals and housing. Deductions for meals and housing are common for live-in workers, and without keeping these records, it is easy to make errors in calculating the worker&rsquo;s wages. Employers can easily keep track of these records using computers or smartphones. I hope you will move this proposal forward!<br/><br/>"

The safety brake has saved one serious finger injury thus far, which has more than repaid any additional cost for the safety feature.  <br/>My understanding is that inclusion of the SawStop technology on all saws would be considerably cheaper per unit due to mass-production efficiencies.   I believe the overall good done by preventing most if not all serious injuries would very easily repay the cost to all of us woodworkers of incorporating the technology.   Yes, prices for table saws would go up somewhat--but how could I put a price on the fingers lost to the two woodworking friends I know who USED to play guitar?   The human cost is much higher, and must be acknowledged in any discussion of the pricing of saws.    <br/>I strongly support this proposed rule.   "

This fall, I plan to enter into a highly competitive Physics and Astronomy Program that is over 60% male. Just over two years ago, I was sexually harassed, coerced, and practically assaulted for six months by my first boyfriend. My experiences left deep psychological wounds, and I attempted to commit suicide shortly thereafter. It is very difficult for me to be surrounded by mostly males in the classes I love the most. I often find myself on the edge of my seat, ready to run if someone attempts to take advantage of me. Boys in my physics class outnumber girls two to one. The year has been rife with anti-feminist, abuse, and rape jokes at my female classmate&#39;s expense. I am often discredited or have my answers stolen by male classmates because &#39;I&#39;m just a pretty girl&#39;.<br/><br/>I love physics - I have one of the highest grades in my class. It means everything to me to be able to study it in college. But I am scared. I am scared that I won&#39;t be safe in the environment that is supposed to support my education and provide me with a tool to hone my passion into a method to better society. I am scared that if I become one of the one in five women sexually assaulted in our country that I will not be believed. I am scared that no serious action will be taken against my perpetrator. But most of all, I am terrified of being unable to pursue the science I love because I cannot emotionally handle being assaulted -again. <br/><br/>Providing an outlet for those who have committed any type of assault -  male or female - to brush aside complaints about their actions is unjustifiable. And, since most victims are female, it silences women across the country and allows men to continue successfully in their field with no hindrance. Forcing victims to immediately report an incident of assault to an authority who can take action is ridiculous. In the scheme of life, my experiences were on the low end of what could have happened to me, and it took me months to face the events that had transpired, let alone discuss them with someone I didn&#39;t know and trust. This delivers yet another blow to women reporting sexual assault on college campuses. Sexual assault does not always leave behind evidence. I myself possess no physical reminder on my body or clothes of what happened to me. Requiring schools to raise their standards of evidence in order to investigate complaints brought forth only decreases the chances of real issues being brought forth. As someone who has already experienced sexual harassment, what am I to make of this? Changes to Title IX communicate to me that my concerns will not be taken seriously. The only reason I survived my experience with sexual assault is because those closest to me believed what I had to say, along with my school. I no longer see the person who harassed me in school because I spoke up.

This fall, I plan to enter into a highly competitive Physics and Astronomy Program that is over 60% male. Just over two years ago, I was sexually harassed, coerced, and practically assaulted for six months by my first boyfriend. My experiences left deep psychological wounds, and I attempted to commit suicide shortly thereafter. It is very difficult for me to be surrounded by mostly males in the classes I love the most. I often find myself on the edge of my seat, ready to run if someone attempts to take advantage of me. Boys in my physics class outnumber girls two to one. The year has been rife with anti-feminist, abuse, and rape jokes at my female classmate&#39;s expense. I am often discredited or have my answers stolen by male classmates because &#39;I&#39;m just a pretty girl&#39;.<br/><br/>I love physics - I have one of the highest grades in my class. It means everything to me to be able to study it in college. But I am scared. I am scared that I won&#39;t be safe in the environment that is supposed to support my education and provide me with a tool to hone my passion into a method to better society. I am scared that if I become one of the one in five women sexually assaulted in our country that I will not be believed. I am scared that no serious action will be taken against my perpetrator. But most of all, I am terrified of being unable to pursue the science I love because I cannot emotionally handle being assaulted -again. <br/><br/>Providing an outlet for those who have committed any type of assault -  male or female - to brush aside complaints about their actions is unjustifiable. And, since most victims are female, it silences women across the country and allows men to continue successfully in their field with no hindrance. Forcing victims to immediately report an incident of assault to an authority who can take action is ridiculous. In the scheme of life, my experiences were on the low end of what could have happened to me, and it took me months to face the events that had transpired, let alone discuss them with someone I didn&#39;t know and trust. This delivers yet another blow to women reporting sexual assault on college campuses. Sexual assault does not always leave behind evidence. I myself possess no physical reminder on my body or clothes of what happened to me. Requiring schools to raise their standards of evidence in order to investigate complaints brought forth only decreases the chances of real issues being brought forth. As someone who has already experienced sexual harassment, what am I to make of this? Changes to Title IX communicate to me that my concerns will not be taken seriously. The only reason I survived my experience with sexual assault is because those closest to me believed what I had to say, along with my school. I no longer see the person who harassed me in school because I spoke up. Knowing that I don&#39;t have to encounter him allows me to marginally relax, even though I remain uncomfortable most of the day. I refuse to allow the same thing to happen to me in college.<br/><br/>I vehemently oppose the Nondiscrimination on the Basis of Sex in Education Programs or Activities Receiving Federal Financial Assistance.

The presence of a bait box in the Tea Garden during<br/>August of 2006 was officially verified through e-mail communication with Chris<br/>Geiger, Ph.D., Integrated Pest Management, San Francisco Department of the<br/>Environment.  The type of poison used was identified as being difethialone in<br/>the form of Generation Blox. E-mail from Chris Geiger, Integrated Pest<br/>Management, San Francisco Department of the Environment, to Lydia<br/>Peirce-Dougherty, SFEnvironment Website Email(Mar. 16, 2007). The incident<br/>described below illustrates the need for second generation anticoagulant risk<br/>mitigation, in particular, the importance of tamper-resistant bait stations.<br/><br/>II.<br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>The Japanese Tea Garden is a popular tourist attraction in Golden Gate Park and<br/>usually filled with visitors.  On August 13th, 2006, a rat was discovered<br/>sitting on a small lawn area near the front of the Tea Garden.  A group of young<br/>children quickly gathered to watch the rat walk about on the lawn, and several<br/>children expressed a desire to touch or play with the animal.  Due to the calm<br/>nature of the rat, coat colouration, and body type, I concluded the rat was a<br/>juvenile domestic Rattus norvegicus.  Domestic Norway rats are occasionally<br/>dumped in Golden Gate Park by negligent owners and require rescue.<br/><br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>When I made my first capture attempt, the rat ran behind a stand of bushes and<br/>huddled next to a black box on the ground.  I immediately asked various Tea<br/>Garden employees for help with the rat, and specifically asked if bait boxes<br/>were being used in the Garden. I was told there were no bait boxes in the Tea<br/>Garden, and so assumed the black box was part of the garden infrastructure.<br/><br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>I followed the rat behind the stand of bushes, and discovered the black box<br/>askew and the surrounding area covered with small yellow pellets.  The word<br/>&#39;poison&#39; was embossed into the plastic cover of the box, yet the writing was<br/>impossible to read without coming into contact with the scattered pellets.  The<br/>top of the box could easily be opened without force.  <br/><br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>I proceeded to pick up the docile rat and was promptly bitten.  The rat died<br/>from massive internal hemorrhage before medical treatment could be obtained.<br/><br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>The deceased rat was later determined by experts to be a female Rattus rattus,<br/>not a juvenile domestic Rattus norvegicus.  The two animals are very difficult<br/>to distinguish, and the extreme illness of the rat made identification more<br/>problematic due to changes in her coat texture and behavior.<br/><br/>III.<br/><br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>The EPA proposed risk mitigation for second generation anticoagulant<br/>rodenticides includes a requirement that all above ground applications be in<br/>tamper-resistant bait stations.  Eight are  criteria used to define a<br/>tamper-resistant bait station; three of those criteria are directly relevant to<br/>the above incident:<br/><br/>3.  . . . capable of being locked or sealed so that children and nontarget<br/>animals cannot gain access through the opening or procedures used to fill the<br/>bait compartment(s);. . .<br/><br/>5. capable of being anchored securely to resist efforts to move the station or<br/>to displace its contents, or equipped with a mechanism which virtually prevents<br/>bait from being shaken out of the station after it has been moved;. . .<br/><br/>6.  equipped with internal structures for containing baits and minimizing<br/>spillage and tracking of bait outside of the station or into readily accessible<br/>parts of the station;. . .

The presence of a bait box in the Tea Garden during<br/>August of 2006 was officially verified through e-mail communication with Chris<br/>Geiger, Ph.D., Integrated Pest Management, San Francisco Department of the<br/>Environment.  The type of poison used was identified as being difethialone in<br/>the form of Generation Blox. E-mail from Chris Geiger, Integrated Pest<br/>Management, San Francisco Department of the Environment, to Lydia<br/>Peirce-Dougherty, SFEnvironment Website Email(Mar. 16, 2007). The incident<br/>described below illustrates the need for second generation anticoagulant risk<br/>mitigation, in particular, the importance of tamper-resistant bait stations.<br/><br/>II.<br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>The Japanese Tea Garden is a popular tourist attraction in Golden Gate Park and<br/>usually filled with visitors.  On August 13th, 2006, a rat was discovered<br/>sitting on a small lawn area near the front of the Tea Garden.  A group of young<br/>children quickly gathered to watch the rat walk about on the lawn, and several<br/>children expressed a desire to touch or play with the animal.  Due to the calm<br/>nature of the rat, coat colouration, and body type, I concluded the rat was a<br/>juvenile domestic Rattus norvegicus.  Domestic Norway rats are occasionally<br/>dumped in Golden Gate Park by negligent owners and require rescue.<br/><br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>When I made my first capture attempt, the rat ran behind a stand of bushes and<br/>huddled next to a black box on the ground.  I immediately asked various Tea<br/>Garden employees for help with the rat, and specifically asked if bait boxes<br/>were being used in the Garden. I was told there were no bait boxes in the Tea<br/>Garden, and so assumed the black box was part of the garden infrastructure.<br/><br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>I followed the rat behind the stand of bushes, and discovered the black box<br/>askew and the surrounding area covered with small yellow pellets.  The word<br/>&#39;poison&#39; was embossed into the plastic cover of the box, yet the writing was<br/>impossible to read without coming into contact with the scattered pellets.  The<br/>top of the box could easily be opened without force.  <br/><br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>I proceeded to pick up the docile rat and was promptly bitten.  The rat died<br/>from massive internal hemorrhage before medical treatment could be obtained.<br/><br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>The deceased rat was later determined by experts to be a female Rattus rattus,<br/>not a juvenile domestic Rattus norvegicus.  The two animals are very difficult<br/>to distinguish, and the extreme illness of the rat made identification more<br/>problematic due to changes in her coat texture and behavior.<br/><br/>III.<br/><br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>The EPA proposed risk mitigation for second generation anticoagulant<br/>rodenticides includes a requirement that all above ground applications be in<br/>tamper-resistant bait stations.  Eight are  criteria used to define a<br/>tamper-resistant bait station; three of those criteria are directly relevant to<br/>the above incident:<br/><br/>3.  . . . capable of being locked or sealed so that children and nontarget<br/>animals cannot gain access through the opening or procedures used to fill the<br/>bait compartment(s);. . .<br/><br/>5. capable of being anchored securely to resist efforts to move the station or<br/>to displace its contents, or equipped with a mechanism which virtually prevents<br/>bait from being shaken out of the station after it has been moved;. . .<br/><br/>6.  equipped with internal structures for containing baits and minimizing<br/>spillage and tracking of bait outside of the station or into readily accessible<br/>parts of the station;. . .

California has more than a decade of experience regulating composters.  We offer comparisons to our current laws and regulations in the hope of standardizing terminology and building upon existing compost product standards and industry best practices.  In that spirit, we would like to make the following recommendations: <br/><br/>This is an excerpt of our formal comment letter.  Please see the letter for our additional comments.<br/><br/>112.54(c)(1) &amp; 112.54(c)(2) &ndash; Requiring Curing piles to be covered<br/>Compost pile curing is a process that occurs at lower temperatures and after the &ldquo;Process to Further Reduce Pathogens&rdquo; (PFRP, Title 14, CCR Section 17868.3).  The curing process is not an extension of the PFRP process.  Covering curing piles can prevent the pile from breathing properly, hindering the curing process.  In addition, this requirement will serve as an operational hardship to composters.  The insulation layer will not be removable and therefore, if a non-compost material is used (e.g. hay), the raw material will have to be certified pathogen and weed free before use, and then incorporated into the pile, which will extend the composting period.  If the insulation layer is comprised of finished compost, it becomes an addition to the curing pile which is nearly indistinguishable from the composting feedstock itself, making enforcement of this rule difficult.<br/><br/>CalRecycle believes that PFRP should be relied upon for pathogen reduction.   The curing process helps reduce other constituents of immature compost which may be harmful to plants.  There are a number of reliable, commercially available tests to measure compost maturity and stability.   California regulations reference both temperature and maturity.  Both definitions below are from CCR, Title 14, Section 17852:<br/>&bull;<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>(1) &quot;Active Compost&quot; means compost feedstock that is in the process of being rapidly decomposed and is unstable. Active compost is generating temperatures of at least 50 degrees Celsius (122 degrees Fahrenheit) during decomposition; or is releasing carbon dioxide at a rate of at least 15 milligrams per gram of compost per day, or the equivalent of oxygen uptake.<br/>&bull;<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>(13) &quot;Curing&quot; means the final stage of the composting process that occurs after compost has undergone pathogen reduction, as described in section 17868.3, and after most of the readily metabolized material has been decomposed and stabilized.<br/>California regulations require that aerated static pile composting processes insulate the active compost during the PFRP to ensure that all of the compostable material achieves proper temperatures.

California has more than a decade of experience regulating composters.  We offer comparisons to our current laws and regulations in the hope of standardizing terminology and building upon existing compost product standards and industry best practices.  In that spirit, we would like to make the following recommendations: <br/><br/>This is an excerpt of our formal comment letter.  Please see the letter for our additional comments.<br/><br/>112.54(c)(1) &amp; 112.54(c)(2) &ndash; Requiring Curing piles to be covered<br/>Compost pile curing is a process that occurs at lower temperatures and after the &ldquo;Process to Further Reduce Pathogens&rdquo; (PFRP, Title 14, CCR Section 17868.3).  The curing process is not an extension of the PFRP process.  Covering curing piles can prevent the pile from breathing properly, hindering the curing process.  In addition, this requirement will serve as an operational hardship to composters.  The insulation layer will not be removable and therefore, if a non-compost material is used (e.g. hay), the raw material will have to be certified pathogen and weed free before use, and then incorporated into the pile, which will extend the composting period.  If the insulation layer is comprised of finished compost, it becomes an addition to the curing pile which is nearly indistinguishable from the composting feedstock itself, making enforcement of this rule difficult.<br/><br/>CalRecycle believes that PFRP should be relied upon for pathogen reduction.   The curing process helps reduce other constituents of immature compost which may be harmful to plants.  There are a number of reliable, commercially available tests to measure compost maturity and stability.   California regulations reference both temperature and maturity.  Both definitions below are from CCR, Title 14, Section 17852:<br/>&bull;<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>(1) &quot;Active Compost&quot; means compost feedstock that is in the process of being rapidly decomposed and is unstable. Active compost is generating temperatures of at least 50 degrees Celsius (122 degrees Fahrenheit) during decomposition; or is releasing carbon dioxide at a rate of at least 15 milligrams per gram of compost per day, or the equivalent of oxygen uptake.<br/>&bull;<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>(13) &quot;Curing&quot; means the final stage of the composting process that occurs after compost has undergone pathogen reduction, as described in section 17868.3, and after most of the readily metabolized material has been decomposed and stabilized.<br/>California regulations require that aerated static pile composting processes insulate the active compost during the PFRP to ensure that all of the compostable material achieves proper temperatures.  Windrow operators are required to turn 5 times for the same purpose, but are not required to insulate.  CCR Title 14, Section 17868.3(4) states:<br/>&bull;<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>If the operation or facility uses an aerated static pile composting process, all active compost shall be covered with 6 to 12 inches of insulating material, and the active compost shall be maintained at a temperature of 55 degrees Celsius (131 degrees Fahrenheit) or higher for a pathogen reduction period of 3 days.<br/>&bull;<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>If the operation or facility uses a windrow composting process, active compost shall be maintained under aerobic conditions at a temperature of 55 degrees Celsius (131 degrees Fahrenheit) or higher for a pathogen reduction period of 15 days or longer.

Congress passed the FMLA in 1993 to provide job-protected leave to workers who need to take time off to care for a new child, for their own serious health condition, or to care for a family member  including a spouse  with a serious health condition. The law has since been amended to provide workers with leave to address certain qualifying exigencies arising from having a family member who is a member of the military. The FMLA is the first and only national law designed to help Americans meet the dual demands of work and family. Workers have taken job-protected leave under the FMLA more than 100 million times since the laws enactment.(1)  Nearly one in five FMLA users takes leave to care for a family members serious health condition.(2)  Without the FMLAs protections, millions of American workers would be at risk of losing their jobs and/or health insurance to attend to family or medical needs.<br/><br/>Although the FMLA allows eligible workers to take job-protected leave to care for a seriously ill spouse and to address qualifying exigencies when a spouse is called to active military duty, the FMLAs regulatory definition of spouse excludes many lawfully married, same-sex spouses. Currently, the FMLAs definition of spouse only applies to same-sex spouses who reside in a state that recognizes their marriage. As a result, LGBT workers who live in a state without marriage equality are often forced to risk their jobs and financial well-being when they need time off to care for a seriously ill spouse or address certain needs relating to a spouses military service.<br/><br/>The proposed rule would fix this problem by adopting a place of celebration rule, where same-sex spouses are recognized if they were lawfully married in any state. This approach will create greater certainty for LGBT workers, whose eligibility for the FMLA will not change if they move to a state that does not recognize their marriage. The proposed rule will also simplify FMLA coverage for employers, who will no longer have to track a workers state of residence when determining FMLA eligibility.<br/><br/>Numerous federal departments and agencies, including the Department of Defense and the Internal Revenue Service, have already adopted a place of celebration rule. In addition, DOL now uses this approach when defining spouses under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act. Therefore, the proposed rule will improve consistency across federal departments and laws, and create greater uniformity for both workers and employers. <br/><br/>Thank you for the opportunity to comment on this proposed rule, which will remove a barrier to FMLA coverage for many same-sex spouses.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/><br/>Kathleen A.

Box 21668<br/>Juneau, AK 99802-1668<br/><br/>Dear Mr. Merrill,<br/><br/>We are writing to comment on the reporting requirements for the proposed rule implementing Amendment 105 to the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands Fishery Management Plan (Amendment 105).  <br/><br/>The Alaska Seafood Cooperative (AKSC) is a harvesting cooperative consisting of sixteen vessels and five companies.  The multi species Amendment 80 sector operates under hard caps for yellowfin sole, flathead sole, rock sole, Pacific cod, Atka mackerel, and Pacific ocean perch, as well as halibut and crab.  The North Pacific Fishery Management Council (Council) intended Amendment 105 to provide additional flexibility for Amendment 80 vessels harvesting yellowfin sole, rock sole, and flathead sole, which could result in more efficient use of these and other species. <br/><br/>We believe that proposed regulations implementing Amendment 105 will assist in maximizing flatfish harvests while maintaining statutory and regulatory harvesting limits.  However, we have several comments about the reporting aspects of these regulations.  <br/><br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>The preamble to the proposed rule and regulations at 679.20(b)(1)(iii)(A) state that the ABC reserve would be set after consultation with the Council or could be reduced if NMFS determines there is a need to set the ABC reserve below the ABC surplus.  To inform ABC reserve decisions, regulations at 679.5(s)(7)(iii) describe information requirements for the Preliminary Amendment 80 Flatfish Exchange Report.  This report proposed to be provided by industry.  However, all of the information required on the Preliminary Amendment 80 Cooperative Flatfish Exchange Report form is available to NMFS.  Requiring cooperatives to report this information is unnecessary and increases costs and reporting burden.  Rather, NMFS could provide the same information to the Council at its December meeting.  <br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Block B of the Flatfish Exchange Report requires information about quota exchanges.  The headings in Block B are titled:  Species Exchanged Into Cooperative Quota and Species Exchanged Out of Reserves.  These headings are asking for the same information.  As described in the proposed regulations, a cooperative would be exchanging CQ of one species for CQ of another species.  For example, a cooperative could relinquish 1000 mt of flathead sole CQ and receive 1000 mt of yellowfin sole CQ.  The cooperative would also exchange an equal amount of ABC reserve for both species.  The current form confuses these two exchanges and should be corrected.  <br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Block A of the Flatfish Exchange Application asks whether the exchange is CDQ or Amendment 80.  Block B also asks for the same information in both the Species Exchanged In and Species Exchanged Out columns.  This creates confusion, and suggests that a cooperative may exchange CDQ CQ for Amendment 80 CQ.  We dont think this was the intention, and should be corrected.  We believe its only necessary to state whether the exchange is CDQ or Amendment 80 in Block A.  <br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>The Flatfish Exchange Application instructions state that the exchange will be exchanged as of the date NMFS approves the exchange application.  The instructions also state No exchange, adjustment, apportionment of flatfish may take effect until NMFS publishes notification in the Federal Register.  The instructions arent clear if these are the same dates, and should be clarified.  Also, NMFS should clarify the process they will follow to ensure there is no delay.  <br/><br/>Feel free to contact me at jasonanderson@seanet.com if you have any questions or need additional input.

I fly my personal airplane for business (real estate) and pleasure with family vacations.  <br/><br/>As an AOPA &amp; EAA member, pilot and proud citizen of our country, I&rsquo;d like to request that public hearings be held on the ADIZ rule affecting Washington D.C.  The issues that surround this ADIZ have been outlined by the AOPA and I strongly agree with their many contentions.  I understand some wayward aviators have violated the DC ADIZ, but also note the incredible response of our homeland defense services and how they quickly responded and escorted those violators under military supervision for further inspection.  General aviation has a great impact on many localities far beyond the gas purchased at the local FBO.

I fly my personal airplane for business (real estate) and pleasure with family vacations.  <br/><br/>As an AOPA &amp; EAA member, pilot and proud citizen of our country, I&rsquo;d like to request that public hearings be held on the ADIZ rule affecting Washington D.C.  The issues that surround this ADIZ have been outlined by the AOPA and I strongly agree with their many contentions.  I understand some wayward aviators have violated the DC ADIZ, but also note the incredible response of our homeland defense services and how they quickly responded and escorted those violators under military supervision for further inspection.

The threat posed by general avaition aircraft is very minor.  Due to the size and payload capacity of most GA aircraft, the typical SUV posses a much greater threat than a GA aircraft for example.  The effects of the Washington DC ADIZ have already costs untold thousands of dollars and numerous loss of jobs for tax-paying United States citizens engaged in the aviation business around Washington DC.  There are other means available to protect secure areas such as TFRs.  A blanket, permanent ADIZ is not the answer.  I urger the FAA to hold public hearings on the issue as well as to follow the recommendations of the Aircraft Oweners and Pilots Association as well as other advocacy groups.  Thank you.<br/>"

I fly throughout the US and Canada commercially but mostly out of western Tennessee in my general aviation flying. I feel that restrictions (especially permanent ones) to airspace use (or any freedoms we have in our great nation) should only be allowed when there are three conditions met. First, there should be clear and continuing threats that the restrictions will definitely prevent. Secondly, the restrictions should be structured to affect the fewest non-threat citizens. Third, they should be lifted as soon as other more effective measures are in place to prevent the same threat. It appears to me that the proposal of a permanent ADIZ around Washington D.C. is not an effective measure, complicates the lives of thousands of flyers who are not a threat, and does not allow easy lifting of the restrictions, and sets a very dangerous precedent for future restrictions. On the contrary, it has been shown that every violator of the temporary ADIZ was determined to be a non-threat; that it complicates the lives and jobs of all pilots and controllers not just the ones it&rsquo;s designed to keep out; that it is expensive and hard to enforce; and that it is a step toward out-of-control restrictions.

I have seen too many cars and trucks have to slam on their brakes to avoid a rear end collision. The drivers for these big companies with governed trucks are very inconsiderte of the trucks and cars who are actually doing the posted speed limit.

But, then, my boss does not tell me I have to drive at least 650 miles each day. My husband and I drive the speed limit, and even when we are in Nebr., Colo, UT, NM, or Arizona, we cannot, nor, do not drive 650 miles in 11 hours of driving. We normally can only drive around 625 miles in an 11 hour period when the speed limit is 75 mph. When we are up in OH, IL, MI, etc, we usually only drive 500 miles per shift. I still have not figured out how the big trucking companies can insist that their drivers go at least 650 miles when their trucks do not go 75 mph like mine does.<br/><br/>Oh, I know, I drive legally!!!!! When I come to a reduced speed zone (like 25 mph down a mountain, or 45 mph in a construction zone), I slow done. It amazes me how many of the trucks from the large trucking companies pass me.

Their governed trucks, in no way, promote safety on our highways! <br/><br/>I can&#39;t tell you how many times I have passed an England or CRST truck, only to have them pass me in a construction zone when the left lane is ending. Then, they pull in front of me and cut me off. This behavior is not safety oriented in any way.

The easiest way to find the carriers that abuse the H.O.S rules the most is to find the carriers with the biggest driver turnover rate. The truckload carriers all pay component pay (miles,stops,ect.) and there is no financial incentive for the carriers to enforce the H.O.S rules.

I&#39;ve been flying since &#39;68 and love it.  GPS is wonderful and I use it too.  When flying instruments, you really must have a back-up.  I don&#39;t know which backs up the other, but they work well together. <br/><br/>We know that solar flares might disrupt GPS operation, our military has demonstrated that hackers or terrorists can render GPS vulnerable, China has shown that they can knock out satelites with their missles. In emergency situations, Loran-C can be easily hardened against Electro-magnetic Pulse.  Because of so few stations, can be more easily defended from terrorism.  Because it&#39;s already in place, the cost to maintain would be a scintillion of what another system might cost.

It causes fish and other wildlife to die and it make watewr undrinkable, unswimmable and unpleasant to look at. Waterways that are naturally algal do exist, but when a traditionally low trophic system becomes choked with algae it kills the local wildlife. Additionally it can be difficult to return the water to its previous state. I am a concerned student at New College of Sarasota, and I want regulation to prevent the excessive amounts of nitrogen and phosphorus in the systems.

You are allowing businesses to be in the business of elevating the cancer risk of Americans by emitting EtO, a known carcinogen and mutagen. There are two fundamental questions that have to be answered as you consider how to regulate these businesses:<br/>1.<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Is EtO a dangerous chemical when emitted into the air?<br/>2.<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Can companies who emit EtO be trusted to accurately measure and report their emissions?<br/><br/>Let&#39;s tackle question #1 since it&#39;s the easiest to answer. You classified it as a human carcinogen in December 2016 so it seems like we can definitively say &quot;yes&quot;. (Source: You guys, the EPA) However, this will not stop the industry from trying to &quot;move the goal posts&quot; arguing that your thresholds for safety are unnecessarily low. Specifically be in the look out for anything from the industry funded ACC and the TCEQ. Both are bogus and not based on peer reviewed science. I&#39;m attaching a file where real scientists express their concern around ACC claims (File name: Actual Scientists Respond to ACC claims.pdf) <br/><br/>Question #2 on whether companies in the EtO emission business can be trusted to accurately measure and report is also fairly easy to answer. Unfortunately the answer is not one that, as citizens of the United States of America, is easy to hear. We can answer unequivocally &quot;no&quot; based on just the small set of independent testing that we have had performed on actual running facilities (Sterigenics in Willobrook, IL and Becton Dickinson (BD) in Covington, GA). <br/><br/>Sterigenics - Independent testing in Willowbrook (really the first of it&#39;s kind as far as I can find) showed many times over the established EPA limits which was also higher than what the self reported. When independent testing was performed after the plant was closed down there was a dramatic drop in EtO levels....coincidence? (See Chicago Links PDF) <br/><br/>BD - Covington city gov&#39;t (not the EPD or EPA) had the fortitude to order independent testing. The testing results showed the levels of EtO around the facility in the area were many times higher than what the EPA considers safe and many times higher than what was self-reported. (Montrose PDF file) What we are seeing here is fact pattern that is very disturbing and central to the ask I am making, we cannot allow self-reporting by these companies as a way to safeguard against excessive EtO emissions. BD has also not shown basic levels of competency as there was a leak that they had to report that somehow existed for several days leaking who knows how much EtO because they only calculated what they believe they put into the air. (Leak article PDF) In addition, they &quot;discovered&quot; a 40,000 sq ft facility in the area that they didn&#39;t realize was storing EtO treated product. (Secret warehouse PDF) And yet we are supposed to trust them with accurately monitoring and reporting their EtO emissions? <br/>What is it exactly that we are looking for? <br/>1.<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>We would love for the world to get out of sterilizing medical equipment with EtO. You need to work with the FDA to incentify companies to utilize other technologies for the same purpose. <br/>2.<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Since there is no way you will have the guts to do #1 - the most critical thing that you can do with these standards is ELIMINATE the ability of companies to self-report their results. Utilizing calculations for how much of a carcinogen they are putting into the air should be acceptable to no one. <br/>a.<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>EtO Sterilizers should have to fund ongoing, independent monitoring (not testing, monitoring) of EtO emissions at the stack and around the perimeter of the facility. Also fund testing around the facility at populated locales. <br/>b.<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>We need to have agreed upon, scientifically proven and peer reviewed, definitive standards on what is allowable for EtO emissions. <br/>c.<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>EtO emissions should not be allowed within schools or population centers of a certain size. It&#39;s absurd that you would allow carcinogens to be put into our children&#39;s bodies. This isn&#39;t sensationalism, it&#39;s fact. <br/>Other:<br/>1.<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Your SBAR Panel should be a moot point.

You are allowing businesses to be in the business of elevating the cancer risk of Americans by emitting EtO, a known carcinogen and mutagen. There are two fundamental questions that have to be answered as you consider how to regulate these businesses:<br/>1.<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Is EtO a dangerous chemical when emitted into the air?<br/>2.<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Can companies who emit EtO be trusted to accurately measure and report their emissions?<br/><br/>Let&#39;s tackle question #1 since it&#39;s the easiest to answer. You classified it as a human carcinogen in December 2016 so it seems like we can definitively say &quot;yes&quot;. (Source: You guys, the EPA) However, this will not stop the industry from trying to &quot;move the goal posts&quot; arguing that your thresholds for safety are unnecessarily low. Specifically be in the look out for anything from the industry funded ACC and the TCEQ. Both are bogus and not based on peer reviewed science. I&#39;m attaching a file where real scientists express their concern around ACC claims (File name: Actual Scientists Respond to ACC claims.pdf) <br/><br/>Question #2 on whether companies in the EtO emission business can be trusted to accurately measure and report is also fairly easy to answer. Unfortunately the answer is not one that, as citizens of the United States of America, is easy to hear. We can answer unequivocally &quot;no&quot; based on just the small set of independent testing that we have had performed on actual running facilities (Sterigenics in Willobrook, IL and Becton Dickinson (BD) in Covington, GA). <br/><br/>Sterigenics - Independent testing in Willowbrook (really the first of it&#39;s kind as far as I can find) showed many times over the established EPA limits which was also higher than what the self reported. When independent testing was performed after the plant was closed down there was a dramatic drop in EtO levels....coincidence? (See Chicago Links PDF) <br/><br/>BD - Covington city gov&#39;t (not the EPD or EPA) had the fortitude to order independent testing. The testing results showed the levels of EtO around the facility in the area were many times higher than what the EPA considers safe and many times higher than what was self-reported. (Montrose PDF file) What we are seeing here is fact pattern that is very disturbing and central to the ask I am making, we cannot allow self-reporting by these companies as a way to safeguard against excessive EtO emissions. BD has also not shown basic levels of competency as there was a leak that they had to report that somehow existed for several days leaking who knows how much EtO because they only calculated what they believe they put into the air. (Leak article PDF) In addition, they &quot;discovered&quot; a 40,000 sq ft facility in the area that they didn&#39;t realize was storing EtO treated product. (Secret warehouse PDF) And yet we are supposed to trust them with accurately monitoring and reporting their EtO emissions? <br/>What is it exactly that we are looking for? <br/>1.<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>We would love for the world to get out of sterilizing medical equipment with EtO. You need to work with the FDA to incentify companies to utilize other technologies for the same purpose. <br/>2.<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Since there is no way you will have the guts to do #1 - the most critical thing that you can do with these standards is ELIMINATE the ability of companies to self-report their results. Utilizing calculations for how much of a carcinogen they are putting into the air should be acceptable to no one. <br/>a.<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>EtO Sterilizers should have to fund ongoing, independent monitoring (not testing, monitoring) of EtO emissions at the stack and around the perimeter of the facility. Also fund testing around the facility at populated locales. <br/>b.<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>We need to have agreed upon, scientifically proven and peer reviewed, definitive standards on what is allowable for EtO emissions. <br/>c.<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>EtO emissions should not be allowed within schools or population centers of a certain size. It&#39;s absurd that you would allow carcinogens to be put into our children&#39;s bodies. This isn&#39;t sensationalism, it&#39;s fact. <br/>Other:<br/>1.<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Your SBAR Panel should be a moot point. We wouldn&#39;t allow a business to continue to kill people because it simply is a small business. Cancer kills people. Carcinogens cause cancer. EtO emitters can literally kill people. Just because they have fewer employees doing it is irrelevant. <br/>2.<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>If there is any complaint about cost please keep in mind that the segment of BD that EtO sterilizers exist in (Medical segment) took in $9.1 billion and had operating income of $2.8 billion for the twelve months ended September 30, 2019.

These funds would be better spent eliminating lead service lines.<br/><br/>Opinion/ Recommendations<br/>It has been well known that lead in drinking water is a health risk for more than a century. This issue was also addressed with the Safe Drinking Water Act nearly fifty years ago. The first Lead and Copper Rule came out nearly thirty years ago. The same towns have the same risks from the same water pipes and appurtenances today that were identified in 1991. With these proposed changes, the actual problem is still being deferred to future generations. Within these revisions, water systems are to be required to maintain complex and fragile scales in pipes to protect the public from lead leaching into their drinking water. While water purveyors take pride in providing the safe drinking water that our customers rely on, maintaining scale in pipes is counterintuitive to our objective of keeping water flowing efficiently. We want to minimize scale or growth in pipes. We want efficient and predictable water flow. Also, most water systems do not have the expertise or resources to meet these rule changes effectively.

These funds would be better spent eliminating lead service lines.<br/><br/>Opinion/ Recommendations<br/>It has been well known that lead in drinking water is a health risk for more than a century. This issue was also addressed with the Safe Drinking Water Act nearly fifty years ago. The first Lead and Copper Rule came out nearly thirty years ago. The same towns have the same risks from the same water pipes and appurtenances today that were identified in 1991. With these proposed changes, the actual problem is still being deferred to future generations. Within these revisions, water systems are to be required to maintain complex and fragile scales in pipes to protect the public from lead leaching into their drinking water. While water purveyors take pride in providing the safe drinking water that our customers rely on, maintaining scale in pipes is counterintuitive to our objective of keeping water flowing efficiently. We want to minimize scale or growth in pipes. We want efficient and predictable water flow. Also, most water systems do not have the expertise or resources to meet these rule changes effectively. We do not have scientists and chemists on staff to manage portions of the proposed rules and we do not have the cooperation of the public. Even with all of the proposed rules followed, we still have no control over private plumbing systems and what changes are made to the water quality in them. Instead of spending millions of dollars testing and monitoring for lead that we already know is a potential problem, we should remove the lead and not allow it to be a risk to generations in the future. <br/><br/>In my opinion this is what should be done:<br/><br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Require Water Systems to identify water services.<br/><br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Require water systems to replace or arrange for the FULL replacement of the service line WITH A DEDICATED DRINKING WATER TAP INSIDE THE HOME JUST AFTER THE MAIN VALVE TO BE PIPED TO A DEDICATED DRINKING WATER FAUCET thereby eliminated the risk of drinking water through the home plumbing system.<br/><br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Facilitate/support the authority of water systems to discontinue the supply of water to a residence until the required replacement of the private portion of the water service line including the DEDICATED DRINKING WATER TAP just past the main valve is completed.<br/><br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>USEPA should make grant money available to finance the private portion of the water service lines INLUDING THE DEDICATED DRINKING WATER TAP if the owner can demonstrate financial hardship to the water system.<br/><br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Eliminate the inefficient lead testing program at homes by water purveyors.

And, it is no secret that negative air quality has plagued LA&#39;s residents for some time.<br/><br/>When President Obama designated the San Gabriel Mountains a National Monument, he demonstrated that he could clearly hear the cries of a city in desperate need of solace from the troubles of urbanization.  Los Angeles is not an equitable city; it is a city divided by income.  Those with money are fortunate; they live in verdant neighborhoods.  Unfortunately, it is those without financial resources who struggle most in this city, who are at the mercy of endless noise and air pollution.  These mountains offer an opportunity for all LA residents, regardless of socioeconomic status to breathe clean air and to listen to the sounds of an open and wild space. <br/><br/>When I first moved to LA, I was saddened by the lack of accessible wilderness, until I discovered the San Gabriel Mountains.  In true LA fashion, I was trapped in what seemed like an endless line of cars all heading into the mountains.  Each car was filled with many different faces from many walks of life.  There were Jaguars and Toyotas from the 1980s.  There were families, extended families, children, dogs, couples, and single folks.  The mountains are the great equalizer.  Once outside of our cars we were all the same.  We were just people in search of peace and connection.  That is beautiful and that is worth protecting.<br/><br/>You could decide that short-term goals are more important than long-term benefits.  You could open these mountains up to extraction, industry, and commercialization.  But haven&#39;t we been there before?  Was it not President Harrison in the late 1800s who declared a Timber Sanctuary in the San Gabriel Mountains?  The reason he did that, of course, was that destruction in the mountains was detrimental to the community below.  <br/><br/>Denude the landscape and destroy all of the resources that one takes for granted.  Los Angeles has never had an abundant water supply.  This is a fact of a southerly latitude, cold ocean temperatures, and prevailing wind patterns.  But the San Gabriel Mountains trap cool and moist Pacific Air.  Thanks to orographic lifting, some of the moisture condenses and falls as rain on the slopes of the San Gabriels, which of course collects into streams and supplies a relatively dry land with water.  A true miracle.  <br/><br/>At the time when President Harrison decided to declare portions of the San Gabriels a Timberland Reserve he did so in response to a decline in overall water quality.

It was developed without engaging Conservation Districts, counties, or states- those with the most knowledge and experience with streams, rivers, and other water resources in our communities.<br/><br/>As written the rule and EPAs comments concerning the rule has created confusion with inconsistencies and  contradicting statements, particularly with regards to extent and reach of the rule.

It was developed without engaging Conservation Districts, counties, or states- those with the most knowledge and experience with streams, rivers, and other water resources in our communities.<br/><br/>As written the rule and EPAs comments concerning the rule has created confusion with inconsistencies and  contradicting statements, particularly with regards to extent and reach of the rule.

Scientists from around the globe challenged man-made global warming claims made by the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and former Vice President Al Gore.

Briggs, a climate statistician explained that his colleagues described &quot;absolute horror stories of what happened to them when they tried getting papers published that explored non-&#39;consensus&#39; views.&quot; In a March 4, 2008, report Briggs described the behavior as &quot;really outrageous and unethical ... on the parts of some editors. &quot;I am a skeptic...Global warming has become a new religion.&quot; - Nobel Prize Winner for Physics, Ivar Giaever. Since I am no longer affiliated with any organization nor receiving any funding, I can speak quite frankly....As a scientist I remain skeptical...The main basis of the claim that man&#39;s release of greenhouse gases is the cause of the warming is based almost entirely upon climate models. We all know the frailty of models concerning the air-surface system.&quot; - Atmospheric Scientist Dr. Joanne Simpson, Warming fears are the &quot;worst scientific scandal in the history...When people come to know what the truth is, they will feel deceived by science and scientists.&quot; - UN IPCC Japanese Scientist Dr. Kiminori Itoh, &quot;The IPCC has actually become a closed circuit; it doesn&#39;t listen to others.

Ahluwalia at Punjab University &quot;So far, real measurements give no ground for concern about a catastrophic future warming.&quot; - Scientist Dr. Jarl R. Ahlbeck, &quot;Anyone who claims that the debate is over and the conclusions are firm has a fundamentally unscientific approach to one of the most momentous issues of our time.&quot;- Solar physicist Dr. Pal Brekke, The models and forecasts of the UN IPCC &quot;are incorrect because they only are based on mathematical models and presented results at scenarios that do not include, for example, solar activity.&quot; - Victor Manuel Velasco Herrera, a researcher at the Institute of Geophysics &quot;It is a blatant lie put forth in the media that makes it seem there is only a fringe of scientists who don&#39;t buy into anthropogenic global warming.&quot; - U.S Government Atmospheric Scientist Stanley B.

With reduce capacity of passengers, the crew must enforce social distancing whenever possible and some ship board attractions may not be viable if they cannot be done safely<br/><br/>I think if the cruise lines could commit to something like this, I would feel safe in cruising again prior to a vaccine being in place and it would still be an enjoyable time without the major risk of spreading the infection further."

This is not just immoral, racist, and incompetent (since it will kill more whites AND blacks than a science-based, rather than racism-based, formula): it is affirmatively evil, because it is purposefully trying to incite racial strife in our nation, when an age-based system would saves more lives for all racial groups in a race-neutral way.<br/><br/>This is also why we must never have government-controlled health care. Governor Sarah Palin warned us about Democrats&#39; death panels. Turns out the panels developing this murderous, racist policy are the death panels she warned us about.<br/><br/>Honest Americans should make every CDC bureaucrat pushing this disgusting bigotry famous, or, rather, infamous. First among them is the racist Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP). What a repugnant collection of bigots. We should long remember the Marxist monsters who will increase death to advance their own lust for power and control. Add these deaths to the 100 million murders Leftists committed worldwide over the last 100 years. You people are disgusting ghouls.<br/><br/>The American people will not forget this."

I believe the existing provision is important for the ease in implementing FMLA leave.

Please reduce the total working hours to 12 and total driving to atleast 10hrs.  It should really be 9 hrs of driving.  11 and 10hrs is an incredible amount of time behind the wheel. I&#39;am always tired after driving 10hrs and then to allow trucking companies to make you work another 2hrs twice a day is totally irresponsible. Please reduce driving hours and working hours. We are tired to being taken advantage of and this is not safe for anyone.

I understand Air Sep is in the design process of a new,lighter machine with longer battery life which will allow a passenger to fly accross the country.<br/>   I also have a liguid oxygen pack called the Helios,manufactured by Puritan Bennet,which weighs only 3 /1/2 pounds and will last for 10 hours. It requires no input energy,electrical or batteries, but is self powered by the oxygen. It&#39;s maximum pressure is approximatly 22 pounds. It is a very safe,quiet device for supplying oxygen and very easy to transport and use. People tend to be afraid of oxygen because of false stories they have heard. It does not explode, it does not start combustion, it only makes existing fires burn hotter. This  device should,and could be approved for use on an airplane. I could tell of sad experiences  with oxygen use on airlines, but it would serve no pourpose.<br/>  I commend you for providing an avenue for comments on proposed regulation changes for the use of oxygen on air craft and urge you to approve  choices for people to use in flight which offer 1)complete safety for everyone involved,2) acceptable and workable for the airline industry,3)as economical as possible because<br/>many  oxygen users are older and have limited incomes.

I understand Air Sep is in the design process of a new,lighter machine with longer battery life which will allow a passenger to fly accross the country.<br/>   I also have a liguid oxygen pack called the Helios,manufactured by Puritan Bennet,which weighs only 3 /1/2 pounds and will last for 10 hours. It requires no input energy,electrical or batteries, but is self powered by the oxygen. It&#39;s maximum pressure is approximatly 22 pounds. It is a very safe,quiet device for supplying oxygen and very easy to transport and use. People tend to be afraid of oxygen because of false stories they have heard. It does not explode, it does not start combustion, it only makes existing fires burn hotter. This  device should,and could be approved for use on an airplane. I could tell of sad experiences  with oxygen use on airlines, but it would serve no pourpose.<br/>  I commend you for providing an avenue for comments on proposed regulation changes for the use of oxygen on air craft and urge you to approve  choices for people to use in flight which offer 1)complete safety for everyone involved,2) acceptable and workable for the airline industry,3)as economical as possible because<br/>many  oxygen users are older and have limited incomes.

I learned of the new proposal issued by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) through an organized consumer association called &quot;The Consumer Advocates for Smoke-free Alternatives Association&quot; (CASAA) that I am a member of. You can visit their web site at:<br/><br/>http://casaa.org<br/><br/>I started using electronic cigarettes 5 years ago and have quit smoking and using tobacco for 4 years. If this proposed regulation was in place then, I doubt I would be tobacco free now. Initially, I saw advertisements on manufacturer&#39;s web sites indicating that using electronic cigarettes are a safer alternative to tobacco cigarettes, which I will call &quot;analog cigarettes.&quot; I grew interested and soon some of my friends started using them. They received information online and on stands for product displays about electronic cigarettes being a safe alternative to smoking. I was skeptical until I saw they quit using analog cigarettes after a while and witnessed their health and quality of life improve.<br/><br/>I decided to buy a simple starter device at a convenience store at that point. I was able to cut back on my use of analog cigarettes, but could not replace them at that point with the device I had. I heard about a good vape shop from a friend and decided to pay a visit. They informed me that I should try using different e-liquid with higher nicotine and higher quality ingredients along with a different device if I wanted to be successful in replacing analog cigarettes.<br/><br/>After about a year, I learned through the vape shops, online advertisements, and word of mouth about other smaller, private companies that produced devices and e-liquid for use as an alternative to smoking analog cigarettes. These products gave me a sufficient experience to that of smoking an analog cigarette, and so the electronic cigarettes replaced the analog cigarettes. In fact, with the current devices I have access to and the quality e-liquids that are out there, I always prefer to use electronic cigarettes over analog cigarettes because of the good flavors and adequate vapor they emit. I enjoy the variety of flavors that are out there, whether it be fruits, candy, baked goods, tobacco, drinks, menthol, or others. It&#39;s also fun to do it yourself (DIY) and make my own flavors. <br/><br/>In the end, I no longer crave tobacco products. Electronic cigarettes have now easily replaced my tobacco use, thanks to companies and people informing me that I can use electronic cigarettes to replace smoking analog cigarettes. As a result of consuming electronic cigarette products, my health and quality of life have much improved. It has become a hobby for me and I am a happier and healthier person as a result of using the safer electronic cigarettes as an alternative to analog cigarettes.<br/><br/>I want to mention an association within the e-liquid industry called American E-Liquid Manufacturing Standards Association (AEMSA), est. 2012. They are making strides in self-regulation including facility, ingredients, traceability, delivery, packaging, and transaction standards in the industry.

I learned of the new proposal issued by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) through an organized consumer association called &quot;The Consumer Advocates for Smoke-free Alternatives Association&quot; (CASAA) that I am a member of. You can visit their web site at:<br/><br/>http://casaa.org<br/><br/>I started using electronic cigarettes 5 years ago and have quit smoking and using tobacco for 4 years. If this proposed regulation was in place then, I doubt I would be tobacco free now. Initially, I saw advertisements on manufacturer&#39;s web sites indicating that using electronic cigarettes are a safer alternative to tobacco cigarettes, which I will call &quot;analog cigarettes.&quot; I grew interested and soon some of my friends started using them. They received information online and on stands for product displays about electronic cigarettes being a safe alternative to smoking. I was skeptical until I saw they quit using analog cigarettes after a while and witnessed their health and quality of life improve.<br/><br/>I decided to buy a simple starter device at a convenience store at that point. I was able to cut back on my use of analog cigarettes, but could not replace them at that point with the device I had. I heard about a good vape shop from a friend and decided to pay a visit. They informed me that I should try using different e-liquid with higher nicotine and higher quality ingredients along with a different device if I wanted to be successful in replacing analog cigarettes.<br/><br/>After about a year, I learned through the vape shops, online advertisements, and word of mouth about other smaller, private companies that produced devices and e-liquid for use as an alternative to smoking analog cigarettes. These products gave me a sufficient experience to that of smoking an analog cigarette, and so the electronic cigarettes replaced the analog cigarettes. In fact, with the current devices I have access to and the quality e-liquids that are out there, I always prefer to use electronic cigarettes over analog cigarettes because of the good flavors and adequate vapor they emit. I enjoy the variety of flavors that are out there, whether it be fruits, candy, baked goods, tobacco, drinks, menthol, or others. It&#39;s also fun to do it yourself (DIY) and make my own flavors. <br/><br/>In the end, I no longer crave tobacco products. Electronic cigarettes have now easily replaced my tobacco use, thanks to companies and people informing me that I can use electronic cigarettes to replace smoking analog cigarettes. As a result of consuming electronic cigarette products, my health and quality of life have much improved. It has become a hobby for me and I am a happier and healthier person as a result of using the safer electronic cigarettes as an alternative to analog cigarettes.<br/><br/>I want to mention an association within the e-liquid industry called American E-Liquid Manufacturing Standards Association (AEMSA), est. 2012. They are making strides in self-regulation including facility, ingredients, traceability, delivery, packaging, and transaction standards in the industry. All of these standards combined provide part of the solution to safe e-liquid consumption. It ensures safety in all aspects of e-liquid manufacturing and shipping to protect workers, consumers, and others. Their website can be found at:<br/><br/>http://www.aemsa.org/<br/><br/>Thank you."
