Specifically, we would narrow the definition of retail pet store so that it means a place of business or residence that each buyer physically enters in order to personally observe the animals available for sale prior to purchase and/or to take custody of the animals after purchase, and where only certain animals are sold or offered for sale, at retail, for use as pets.  Retail pet stores are not required to be licensed and inspected under the AWA.  We are also proposing to increase from three to four the number of breeding female dogs, cats, and/or small exotic or wild mammals that a person may maintain on his or her premises and be exempt from the licensing and inspection requirements if he or she sells only the offspring of those animals born and raised on his or her premises, for pets or exhibition.

Starting June 13, 2019, use the following link: https://trade.gov/232/steelalum for the submittal of new exclusion requests. 

Exclusion requests and objections to submitted exclusion requests for STEEL must be submitted to regulations.gov docket number BIS-2018-0006. 

This regulations.gov docket number BIS-2018-0006 is being used for three purposes:

(1) Submitting comments on the interim final rule;
(2) Submitting exclusion requests for steel; and
(3) Submitting objections to submitted exclusion requests for steel. 

Summary of interim final rule:
This interim final rule amends the National Security Industrial Base Regulations to add two new supplements.  The new supplements set forth the process for how parties in the United States may submit requests for exclusions from actions taken by the President (“exclusion requests”) to protect national security from threats resulting from imports of specified articles.  The new supplements also set forth the requirements and process for how parties in the United States may submit objections to the granting of an exclusion request.  

The supplements are being added to implement Presidential Proclamations 9704 and 9705 of March 8, 2018 (“Proclamations”), adjusting imports of steel articles identified in Proclamation 9705 (“steel”) and aluminum articles identified in Proclamation 9704 (“aluminum”) through the imposition of duties so that imports of steel articles and aluminum articles will no longer threaten to impair the national security.  As set forth in the Proclamations, the President concurred with the findings of the Secretary of Commerce (“Secretary”) in two reports to the President on the investigations under section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1862), of the effect of imports of steel and aluminum, respectively, on the national security of the United States.  The Proclamations authorize the Secretary to grant exclusions from the duties upon request of affected parties if the steel or aluminum articles are determined not to be produced in the United States in a sufficient and reasonably available amount or of a satisfactory quality or based upon specific national security considerations.  The President directed the Secretary to promulgate regulations as may be necessary to set forth the procedures for an exclusion process.

NOTE: For exclusion requests and objections to submitted exclusion requests for aluminum see regulations.gov docket number BIS-2018-0002.",0,0

Electromyography is an important part of my practice, as I see referrals from several very busy neurosurgical and orthopedic groups.  The fact is that many of these patients are of the &quot;Medicare age,&quot; which means that my fees for performing these studies are already heavily discounted.  Moreover, I see patients referred by the nearby VA hospital&#39;s Compensation and Pension Clinic, and they use Medicare fees.  By cutting these already-discounted fees by essentially another 55 to 65%, CMS is putting neurologists in an untenable position----either to continue to see these patients and basically incur a loss due to ever-increasing overhead, or simply to stop seeing such patients, maybe hoping that &quot;somebody else&quot; will fill the void.

Electromyography is an important part of my practice, as I see referrals from several very busy neurosurgical and orthopedic groups.  The fact is that many of these patients are of the &quot;Medicare age,&quot; which means that my fees for performing these studies are already heavily discounted.  Moreover, I see patients referred by the nearby VA hospital&#39;s Compensation and Pension Clinic, and they use Medicare fees.  By cutting these already-discounted fees by essentially another 55 to 65%, CMS is putting neurologists in an untenable position----either to continue to see these patients and basically incur a loss due to ever-increasing overhead, or simply to stop seeing such patients, maybe hoping that &quot;somebody else&quot; will fill the void.

As any visitor to LA can see, much of the city has fallen victim to urbanization.  <br/><br/>As with any city, not all locations in the city are created equally.  One needs only look at recent scientific studies focused on the negative effects of noise and air pollution on individuals to understand the impacts that these aspects of LA&#39;s urban landscape have on its residents.  In fact, LA was recently singled out as having the worst noise pollution in the country.  And, it is no secret that negative air quality has plagued LA&#39;s residents for some time.<br/><br/>When President Obama designated the San Gabriel Mountains a National Monument, he demonstrated that he could clearly hear the cries of a city in desperate need of solace from the troubles of urbanization.  Los Angeles is not an equitable city; it is a city divided by income.  Those with money are fortunate; they live in verdant neighborhoods.  Unfortunately, it is those without financial resources who struggle most in this city, who are at the mercy of endless noise and air pollution.  These mountains offer an opportunity for all LA residents, regardless of socioeconomic status to breathe clean air and to listen to the sounds of an open and wild space. <br/><br/>When I first moved to LA, I was saddened by the lack of accessible wilderness, until I discovered the San Gabriel Mountains.  In true LA fashion, I was trapped in what seemed like an endless line of cars all heading into the mountains.  Each car was filled with many different faces from many walks of life.  There were Jaguars and Toyotas from the 1980s.  There were families, extended families, children, dogs, couples, and single folks.  The mountains are the great equalizer.  Once outside of our cars we were all the same.  We were just people in search of peace and connection.  That is beautiful and that is worth protecting.<br/><br/>You could decide that short-term goals are more important than long-term benefits.  You could open these mountains up to extraction, industry, and commercialization.  But haven&#39;t we been there before?  Was it not President Harrison in the late 1800s who declared a Timber Sanctuary in the San Gabriel Mountains?  The reason he did that, of course, was that destruction in the mountains was detrimental to the community below.  <br/><br/>Denude the landscape and destroy all of the resources that one takes for granted.  Los Angeles has never had an abundant water supply.  This is a fact of a southerly latitude, cold ocean temperatures, and prevailing wind patterns.  But the San Gabriel Mountains trap cool and moist Pacific Air.  Thanks to orographic lifting, some of the moisture condenses and falls as rain on the slopes of the San Gabriels, which of course collects into streams and supplies a relatively dry land with water.  A true miracle.  <br/><br/>At the time when President Harrison decided to declare portions of the San Gabriels a Timberland Reserve he did so in response to a decline in overall water quality.  A water that the growing city of LA had become dependent upon.  In this designation, he understood that the long-term benefits far outweighed the short-term gain of fleeting resources.<br/><br/>Today, the San Gabriel&#39;s still provide local water. They still trap moist cool Pacific air, leading to a more hospitable climate.  They are the home to unique vegetation, to ancient predators, to our cultural past, and to a peace that can only be known on its slopes.  <br/><br/>As a geologist, I understand the the Earth is always changing, but as a human I understand the time we spend on it can seem long.

Allowing such treatment to occur prevents students from being able to fully engage in curriculum and activities and has lasting, negative effects on their life. <br/><br/>The proposed modifications of Title IX put an unfair burden on victims of sexual harassment and rely on sexist stereotypes. Our schools should be held to a higher standard concerning resources they have available for victimized students and higher standards concerning discipline and consequences that are imposed on their students and staff who are perpetrators of sexual harassment. We cannot continue to look the other way when we learn of cases of sexual harassment. We cannot pass this proposed rule into law!<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Sarah<br/>Seattle, WA<br/><br/>",,0,0

This NESHAP was promulgated pursuant to section 112(d) of the Clean Air Act (CAA) and established emission limitations and work practice requirements based on maximum achievable control technology (MACT) for controlling emissions of hazardous air pollutants. The MON, subpart FFFF, was promulgated pursuant to section 112(d) of the Clean Air Act (CAA) on November 10, 2003. The NESHAP controls emissions of HAP from continuous process vents, batch process vents, storage tanks, equipment leaks, wastewater streams, transfer racks and heat exchange systems. This review implements the residual risk review requirements of CAA section 112(f)(2) and the technology review requirements of CAA section 112(d)(6). CAA 112(f)(2) directs EPA to revise the NESHAP if such revisions are required to provide an ample margin of safety to protect public health or to prevent, taking relevant factors into account, an adverse environmental effect. CAA section 112(d)(6) requires the EPA to review and revise the MACT standards as necessary, taking into account developments in practices, processes and control technologies, no less often than every 8 years.",1,1

However, the application for certain situations is a bit disconcerting and causes morale problems.  We would appreciate it if you would please consider the following scenarios when rewriting the law.<br/><br/>Travel to foreign countries<br/>1.  We have a very diverse community of employees.  Many are from India, Bangladesh and similarly remote areas of the world. Currently our FMLA year is calendar based although we will be changing this in the future.<br/>We find that when these employees are at work, they are very good workers but it is amazing how many of them receive notification from a relative that their parent is sick and they must return home.  Most of these requests come in the October/Nov timeframe.  The employees are given the appropriate FMLA paperwork.  They fly to their native country and someone faxes the completed paperwork back to us.  We have no good way of verifying that the person completing the paperwork is a doctor or if there is actually a medical situation for which they are needed.  On the occasions where we called to verify information, no one spoke English.  <br/><br/>Taking matters to the next step, several of these same employees provide additional documentation in mid-end December (they are still out on their original FMLA leave and still in their native country) that another parent has fallen ill and requires their assistance.  Additional paperwork and certs are provided and the process begins again.  These empoyees are staying out of work for up to 24 weeks (12 for the current year, 12 for the new year) and we cannot validate the situation. It causes a great morale problem especially when some return and are married.  They talk openly among themselves that they must return home to marry but we cannot disprove the medical information.  Obviously something isn&#39;t quite right with this.  Since you are re-evaluating the law, please give some consideration to how employers are able to provide timeoff while still being assured that they are dealing with legitimate medical facilities around the world.  <br/><br/>2.  Intermittent FMLA places undue hardship on employers.  For example, situations such as asthma, in which a child may need periodic treatments, are truly justifiable however, when employers are prevented from asking for medical documention each time someone is out to care for someone, the employer is placed in a difficult situation.  Again,the appropriate forms are completed and returned; However, it is amazing how many children get asthma attacks on Mondays and Fridays.  We do watch for trends and when they occur, we speak to the individual but the story<br/>is always the same.  Their child had an asthma attack.   If the law<br/>would permit us to require a doctor&#39;s note for each day that they are out on intermittent leave, we believe that some of the abuse would be<br/>slowed.   <br/><br/>I travel to each of our sites and I realize FMLA is a valuable benefit when it is medically justified.  Unfortunately,  many employees stop to ask me what I can do to stop the abuse.  Employees talk to one another.<br/>They tell each other the real reason why they&#39;re not at work and laugh that they are &quot;protected&quot; under the law.  <br/><br/>Thank you for listening.  Please give our issues some consideration as you re-write the law.  Employers want to provide the appropriate time-off for true medical situations but when we are prevented from getting the documentation that we need in order to apply this law fairly, we are all placed in a difficult situation.  <br/><br/>Thank you,<br/><br/>Penny C.

However, the application for certain situations is a bit disconcerting and causes morale problems.  We would appreciate it if you would please consider the following scenarios when rewriting the law.<br/><br/>Travel to foreign countries<br/>1.  We have a very diverse community of employees.  Many are from India, Bangladesh and similarly remote areas of the world. Currently our FMLA year is calendar based although we will be changing this in the future.<br/>We find that when these employees are at work, they are very good workers but it is amazing how many of them receive notification from a relative that their parent is sick and they must return home.  Most of these requests come in the October/Nov timeframe.  The employees are given the appropriate FMLA paperwork.  They fly to their native country and someone faxes the completed paperwork back to us.  We have no good way of verifying that the person completing the paperwork is a doctor or if there is actually a medical situation for which they are needed.  On the occasions where we called to verify information, no one spoke English.  <br/><br/>Taking matters to the next step, several of these same employees provide additional documentation in mid-end December (they are still out on their original FMLA leave and still in their native country) that another parent has fallen ill and requires their assistance.  Additional paperwork and certs are provided and the process begins again.  These empoyees are staying out of work for up to 24 weeks (12 for the current year, 12 for the new year) and we cannot validate the situation. It causes a great morale problem especially when some return and are married.  They talk openly among themselves that they must return home to marry but we cannot disprove the medical information.  Obviously something isn&#39;t quite right with this.  Since you are re-evaluating the law, please give some consideration to how employers are able to provide timeoff while still being assured that they are dealing with legitimate medical facilities around the world.  <br/><br/>2.  Intermittent FMLA places undue hardship on employers.  For example, situations such as asthma, in which a child may need periodic treatments, are truly justifiable however, when employers are prevented from asking for medical documention each time someone is out to care for someone, the employer is placed in a difficult situation.  Again,the appropriate forms are completed and returned; However, it is amazing how many children get asthma attacks on Mondays and Fridays.  We do watch for trends and when they occur, we speak to the individual but the story<br/>is always the same.  Their child had an asthma attack.   If the law<br/>would permit us to require a doctor&#39;s note for each day that they are out on intermittent leave, we believe that some of the abuse would be<br/>slowed.   <br/><br/>I travel to each of our sites and I realize FMLA is a valuable benefit when it is medically justified.  Unfortunately,  many employees stop to ask me what I can do to stop the abuse.  Employees talk to one another.<br/>They tell each other the real reason why they&#39;re not at work and laugh that they are &quot;protected&quot; under the law.  <br/><br/>Thank you for listening.  Please give our issues some consideration as you re-write the law.  Employers want to provide the appropriate time-off for true medical situations but when we are prevented from getting the documentation that we need in order to apply this law fairly, we are all placed in a difficult situation.  <br/><br/>Thank you,<br/><br/>Penny C.

It would take terrorist planners just a moment of thought to rule out using small aircraft, as evidenced by the poor misguided young man who sympathetically flew the small aircraft into the office building in Florida shortly after 9/11. The airplane didn&rsquo;t even make it all the way into the building.<br/><br/>There have been far more damage and lost of life by terrorists through the use of cars, trucks, and pedestrians.<br/><br/>The ADIZ is too large. It covers large areas of nonessential airspace. I have flown into the ADIZ on 3 occasions and have found it to be poorly thought through, administered clumsily, and stressful.

Congress passed the FMLA in 1993 to provide job-protected leave to workers who need to take time off to care for a new child, for their own serious health condition, or to care for a family member  including a spouse  with a serious health condition. The law has since been amended to provide workers with leave to address certain qualifying exigencies arising from having a family member who is a member of the military. The FMLA is the first and only national law designed to help Americans meet the dual demands of work and family. Workers have taken job-protected leave under the FMLA more than 100 million times since the laws enactment.(1)  Nearly one in five FMLA users takes leave to care for a family members serious health condition.(2)  Without the FMLAs protections, millions of American workers would be at risk of losing their jobs and/or health insurance to attend to family or medical needs.<br/><br/>Although the FMLA allows eligible workers to take job-protected leave to care for a seriously ill spouse and to address qualifying exigencies when a spouse is called to active military duty, the FMLAs regulatory definition of spouse excludes many lawfully married, same-sex spouses. Currently, the FMLAs definition of spouse only applies to same-sex spouses who reside in a state that recognizes their marriage. As a result, LGBT workers who live in a state without marriage equality are often forced to risk their jobs and financial well-being when they need time off to care for a seriously ill spouse or address certain needs relating to a spouses military service.<br/><br/>The proposed rule would fix this problem by adopting a place of celebration rule, where same-sex spouses are recognized if they were lawfully married in any state. This approach will create greater certainty for LGBT workers, whose eligibility for the FMLA will not change if they move to a state that does not recognize their marriage. The proposed rule will also simplify FMLA coverage for employers, who will no longer have to track a workers state of residence when determining FMLA eligibility.<br/><br/>Numerous federal departments and agencies, including the Department of Defense and the Internal Revenue Service, have already adopted a place of celebration rule. In addition, DOL now uses this approach when defining spouses under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act. Therefore, the proposed rule will improve consistency across federal departments and laws, and create greater uniformity for both workers and employers. <br/><br/>Thank you for the opportunity to comment on this proposed rule, which will remove a barrier to FMLA coverage for many same-sex spouses.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/><br/>Kathleen A.

This expanded benefit to my daughter and her family would then ease my concerns and worries several states away. <br/><br/>I hope that you not only consider the benefits that the expansion of the Act grants same sex spouses, but also the extended benefits it offers to their extended families.<br/><br/>The rights established by the FMLA are critically important to Americans balancing work and caregiving responsibilities. Congress passed the FMLA in 1993 to provide job-protected leave to workers who need to take time off to care for a new child, for their own serious health condition, or to care for a family member  including a spouse  with a serious health condition. The law has since been amended to provide workers with leave to address certain qualifying exigencies arising from having a family member who is a member of the military. The FMLA is the first and only national law designed to help Americans meet the dual demands of work and family. Workers have taken job-protected leave under the FMLA more than 100 million times since the laws enactment.  Nearly one in five FMLA users takes leave to care for a family members serious health condition.  Without the FMLAs protections, millions of American workers would be at risk of losing their jobs and/or health insurance to attend to family or medical needs.<br/><br/>Although the FMLA allows eligible workers to take job-protected leave to care for a seriously ill spouse and to address qualifying exigencies when a spouse is called to active military duty, the FMLAs regulatory definition of spouse excludes many lawfully married, same-sex spouses. Currently, the FMLAs definition of spouse only applies to same-sex spouses who reside in a state that recognizes their marriage. As a result, LGBT workers who live in a state without marriage equality are often forced to risk their jobs and financial well-being when they need time off to care for a seriously ill spouse or address certain needs relating to a spouses military service.<br/><br/>The proposed rule would fix this problem by adopting a place of celebration rule, where same-sex spouses are recognized if they were lawfully married in any state. This approach will create greater certainty for LGBT workers, whose eligibility for the FMLA will not change if they move to a state that does not recognize their marriage. The proposed rule will also simplify FMLA coverage for employers, who will no longer have to track a workers state of residence when determining FMLA eligibility.<br/><br/>Numerous federal departments and agencies, including the Department of Defense and the Internal Revenue Service, have already adopted a place of celebration rule. In addition, DOL now uses this approach when defining spouses under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act. Therefore, the proposed rule will improve consistency across federal departments and laws, and create greater uniformity for both workers and employers. <br/><br/>Thank you for the opportunity to comment on this proposed rule, which will remove a barrier to FMLA coverage for many same-sex spouses.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/><br/>Patricia Davis-Weeks<br/>National Officer<br/>American Postal Workers Union<br/><br/>4409 Minnehaha Street<br/>Tampa, FL 33614<br/>813-334-0301<br/>', 'country': None, 'displayProperties': [{'name': 'pageCount', 'label': 'Page Count', 'tooltip': 'Number of pages In the content file'}], 'docAbstract': None, 'docketId': 'WHD-2014-0002', 'documentType': 'Public Submission', 'email': None, 'fax': None, 'field1': None, 'field2': None, 'fileFormats': None, 'firstName': 'Patricia', 'govAgency': None, 'govAgencyType': None, 'objectId': '090000648181673b', 'lastName': 'Davis Weeks', 'legacyId': None, 'modifyDate': '2014-08-11T13:42:10Z', 'organization': None, 'originalDocumentId': None, 'pageCount': 0, 'phone': None, 'postedDate': '2014-08-09T04:00:00Z', 'postmarkDate': None, 'reasonWithdrawn': None, 'receiveDate': '2014-08-09T15:39:03Z', 'restrictReason': None, 'restrictReasonType': None, 'stateProvinceRegion': None, 'submitterRep': None, 'submitterRepAddress': None, 'submitterRepCityState': None, 'subtype': None, 'title': 'Davis Weeks, Patricia (American Postal Workers Union)', 'trackingNbr': '1jy-8dp3-9x3q', 'withdrawn': False, 'zip': None, 'openForComment': False}",WHD-2014-0002,"August 9, 2014<br/><br/>Mary Ziegler<br/>Director, Division of Regulations, Legislation, and Interpretation <br/>U.S. Department of Labor, Wage and Hour Division<br/>200 Constitution Avenue N.W., Room S-3502 <br/>Washington, DC 20210<br/><br/>Re: Proposed Department of Labor Rule on Definition of Spouse in the FMLA (RIN 1235-AA09) <br/><br/>Dear Ms. Ziegler, <br/><br/>As a mother of a daughter who is in a wonderful and stable 20 plus year relationship with her same sex spouse, I strongly support the Department of Labors (DOL) proposed change to the definition of spouse in the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) to refer to all legally married individuals, including same-sex spouses who live in a state that does not recognize same-sex marriage (RIN 1235-AA09).<br/><br/>In addition to the benefits that this would grant my daughter and daughter-in-law, the benefits would also offer great relief to parents who, like me, live out of state from their children.
